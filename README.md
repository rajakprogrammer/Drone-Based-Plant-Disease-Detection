Agriculture plays a crucial role in the global food economy and food 
security. Crop yields are reducing day to day because of plant disease. So, 
innovative solutions are important to tackle plant diseases and maximize crop 
yields. Traditional methods of detecting crop diseases are slow, costly, and often 
inexact, leading to significant crop losses and food shortages. Aero crop 
Diagnostics (ACD) addresses these challenges by integrating drones and 
advanced deep learning algorithms for exact and efficient plant disease detection. 
By using the Mavic 2 pro drone in Webots robotic simulator and the 
DenseNet121 model, ACD captures high-resolution images of plant leaves and 
processes them in realtime through a user-friendly Flask web application. This 
approach significantly improves the speed and accuracy of disease diagnosis, 
providing farmers with useful analysis. The DenseNet121 model achieved a 
training accuracy of 97.90% and a testing accuracy of 96.44%, overcoming 
traditional methods and existing studies in terms of accuracy and efficiency, 
ACD's innovative technology builds the way for more Eco-friendly and 
prosperous farming practices.
